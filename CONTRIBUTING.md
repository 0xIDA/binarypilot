   cd binarypilot
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies**

   # or manually:
   uv sync
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Configure your LLM provider**

## 📚 Contributing Skills

Skills are specialized knowledge packages that enhance agent capabilities. See [binarypilot/skills/README.md](binarypilot/skills/README.md) for detailed guidelines.

### Quick Guide

1. **Choose the right category** (`/vulnerabilities`, `/frameworks`, `/technologies`, etc.)
2. **Create a** `.md` file with your skill content
3. **Include practical examples** - Working payloads, commands, or test cases
4. **Provide validation methods** - How to confirm findings and avoid false positives
5. **Submit via PR** with clear description

## 🔧 Contributing Code

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create an issue first** - Describe the problem or feature
2. **Fork and branch** - Work from the `main` branch
3. **Make your changes** - Follow existing code style
4. **Write/update tests** - Ensure coverage for new features
5. **Run quality checks** - `make check-all` should pass
6. **Submit PR** - Link to issue and provide context

### PR Guidelines

- **Clear description** - Explain what and why
- **Small, focused changes** - One feature/fix per PR
- **Include examples** - Show before/after behavior
- **Update documentation** - If adding features
- **Pass all checks** - Tests, linting, type checking

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 with 100-character line limit
- Use type hints for all functions
- Write docstrings for public methods
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:

- Python version and OS
- BinaryPilot version
- LLMs being used
- Full error traceback
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior

## 💡 Feature Requests

We welcome feature ideas! Please:

- Check existing issues first
- Describe the use case clearly
- Explain why it would benefit users
- Consider implementation approach
- Be open to discussion

## 🖥️ Local viewer SPA

`binarypilot view` serves a prebuilt web UI whose source lives in
`binarypilot/interface/viewer/frontend/` (a Vite + React project) and whose built output is
committed to `binarypilot/interface/viewer/static/` and shipped in the package. End users never
run a JS build. If you change anything under `binarypilot/interface/viewer/frontend/`, rebuild
and commit the output:

```bash
make viewer   # or: cd binarypilot/interface/viewer/frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

Commit both the source change and the regenerated `binarypilot/interface/viewer/static/`.
